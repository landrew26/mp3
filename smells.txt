Question 1:
The code smell was repeated code. We created a function called tryAddPluginToMapthat took two parameters: a Map and a plugin. This method replaced two instances of the same code.

Question 3: 
Since updateAndTrim is already using jenkins.updateComputerList() and jenkins.trimLabels(), so we should have the function we created in Jenkins.java instead of Nodes.java.

Question 4: 
The four statements can be reduced into one within a for or while loop.

Question 6:
Using pmd we found duplicated code in the HudsonTestCase.java file starting at line 1056. We chose to extract these 10 repeated lines into a seperate function.
